Raspberry-Pi-Drupal-7
=====================

Drupal 7 & Dependency Installation Shell Script for the Raspberry Pi.  This is ideal for a local wiki, but with the proper port forwarding it can be used externally.

<h3>Installation Instructions:</h3>

    git http://github.com/LikeABoss-001/Raspberry-Pi-Drupal-7.git
    cd ~/Raspberry-Pi-Drupal-7
    sudo bash install.sh
    
That's it!  Your local wiki is now set up and can be accessed by going to http://(your-local-ip)/drupal7  or http://licalhost/drupal7 if your on your Raspberry Pi.

Have Fun!!
